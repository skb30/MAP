PROCEDURE TO BUILD AND LOAD INFO/X REPOSITORY Last Update 8/3/10 by L. Crawford



1)	After initial installation and PCFILE is built, remember to add the password authorization 
    library to the STEPLIB in these places:
	a.	Started task - DSSISTC7 (copied from Install library to SYSP.USER.PROCLIB)
	b.	QAL.MGH.R300. QAMGH01.INSTALL, members PR1PROC, PR1PROCT, and STEPLIB1

2)	Build the INFO/X repository from the installation interface in exactly this order and pay
    attention to the return codes - should never get anything above 4 - see below:
	a.	1-Create the database - should get RC 0
	b.	2-Prime the database - should get RC 0
	c.	3-Bind Packages and plan(s) - should get RC 0
	d.	4-Grant Access to the database and plans - should get either
        RC 0 or RC 4 (gets RC 4 if grants already exist)
	e.	5-Grant access to individual users for batch i/x - should get
        either RC 0 or RC 4 (gets RC 4 if grants already exist)
	f.	6-Populate the database w/ demo data - should get RC 0
	g.	7-Populate the database w/ DB2 xref info - should get RC 0 on 
        all steps except usually gets  RC 4 on the second DSNUPROC
		step for a copy pending issue.  This is okay to ignore.
		
       IMPORTANT UPDATE 6/25/10 for PR290 only:  system programmer  
        changed something in D9EQ that causes SSID to be corrupted.
        Before running this job, search for SSID, then remove 
        the 'BIT' from 'CHAR BIT' in every case - there are several.
        Mike White says this will be fixed in R300.
       
	h.	8-Populate the database w/ CICS xref info - should get RC 0
	i.	9-Run DB2 REORG & RUNSTATS on the database - should get RC 0

3)	Load the INFO/X repository from the Product update panel (not the installtion interface update panel)  with QAL.MGH.WGR.DB2WIN but EXCLUDE member
    JS970363 - this is a known bug.  (Use Processing Mode=JOB) This will take a long time - over 2 hours.
    This gets RC 16 - this is okay.

4)	Load the repository from the Update panel with QAL.MGH.WGR.LOAD. (Use Processing Mode= LOADMODULE)  Should get RC=0.

5)	Load the repository from the Update panel with QAL.MGH.WGR.PROCLIB. (Use Processing Mode=JOB) Should get RC=0.

6)	Re-run these jobs from the INFO/X installation interface in exactly this order (same return codes as above):
	a.	9-Run DB2 REORG & RUNSTATS on the database
	b.	7-Populate the database w/ DB2 xref info (remember to exclude 'BIT' - see step 2g above)
	c.	3-Bind Packages and plan(s) 

7)	Load the INFO/X repository with the long column data:
	a.	Insert long data into repository by submitting QAL.MGH.P97308.JCL.CNTL(I97308I) - should get RC 0.
	    (Make sure SQLID is the OWNER/AUTHID specified in the installation interface (QAMGH01).
	b.	Submit this job QAL.MGH.P97308.JCL.CNTL(IE97308) - this gets RC 8 - this is okay.

NOTE:  If you re-run option "6b-Populate the database w/ DB2 xref info" after you load the long column data, it wipes out the
       long column data, so you need to re-load the long column data again.



8)	Run job QAL.MGH.WGR.DB2WIN(C1A019SS) after making the following changes.   
	a.	QUALIFIER and OWNER should be the Primary Authid specified in the installation interface (QAMGH01)
	b.	PACKAGE should be the  Collection ID specified in the installation interface (QACI290)
	c.	LIBRARY should be the current  DBRM library (QAL.MGH.PR290$.QAMGH01.DBRM)
